# Exercise
## Parsing and visualizing USGS Gage Data
This exercise is meant to provide some more realistic real-world practice with 
your new python coding skills by having learners load and parse  real USGS 
gage data.

## Overview
1. You will clone this repository, which contains the data and these instructions,
   to your local computer.
2. Then, you will create python code to load and manipulate the supplied data.
3. Finally, you will share your results back to the repository by creating and uploading your work to a 
   remote git branch and issuing a pull request.

## Step one: Cloning this repository
Use the skills you learned during Day 1 of the 
[https://annajiat.github.io/2021-08-17-usgs-ngwos-online/](Software Carpentries Workshop)
to clone this repository to your local machine. The project page for this repository is:
[https://github.com/frank-engel-usgs/softwarecarpentry-usgs-aug2021]

**Hint:** You will want to `clone` this repo using git bash or other git client.

  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  Open a git bash window in the location you wish your clone of the repository to live.
  Then, issue the command:

  ```buildoutcfg
  git clone https://annajiat.github.io/2021-08-17-usgs-ngwos-online/
  ```

  Conversely, if using ssh, the command would be:
```buildoutcfg
git clone git@github.com:frank-engel-usgs/softwarecarpentry-usgs-aug2021.git
```
